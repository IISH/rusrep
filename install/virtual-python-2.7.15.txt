Create a virtualenv Python-2.7.15

Used with CentOS-7.4
	use the _new_ setuptools
	use pip instead of easy_install
	use unicode ucs4 instead of ucs2

-1- Create a normal Python-2.7.15 from its source. 
	Get Python-2.7.15 from https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2715/
		$ tar -zxf Python-2.7.15.tgz
		$ cd Python-2.7.15
	Installation directory will be: ~/opt/Python/python-2.7.15
		$ export PYTHON_LOCAL=~/opt/Python/python-2.7.15
		$ ./configure --enable-unicode=ucs4 --prefix=$PYTHON_LOCAL --with-ensurepip=yes
		If you want a release build with all optimizations active (LTO, PGO, etc),
		please run ./configure --enable-optimizations
		
		$ make

		The following warnings can be ignored: 
		Python build finished, but the necessary bits to build these modules were not found:
			bsddb185			# "Berkeley db 1.85": really old version, so forget it.
			dl					# "SGI-specific modules", so forget it.
			imageop				# "These don't work for 64-bit platforms", so forget it.
			sunaudiodev			# "SunOS specific", so forget it.
		To find the necessary bits, look in setup.py in detect_modules() for the module's name.

		If there are other modules that could not be built, that can be remedied by installing 
		the needed additional linux packages, and re-make. 
		
		$ make altinstall		# alt: do not [try to] replace /usr/bin/python
		...
		Collecting setuptools
		Collecting pip
		Installing collected packages: setuptools, pip
		Successfully installed pip-9.0.3 setuptools-39.0.1

	Create a script ~/bin/python2715
	activate this python
		$ source ~/bin/python2715
	check: 
		$ python -V

-2- setuptools & pip
	already installed, see --with-ensurepip=yes above, 
	but notice that they are 'versioned' in $PYTHON_LOCAL/python-2.7.15/bin
		easy_install-2.7 pip2.7 python2.7

-3- Add virtualenv
		$ pip2.7 install virtualenv
		Successfully installed virtualenv-16.0.0

-4- Create a virtualenv python for RusRep somewhere, say in PROJECT
		$ cd $PROJECT
	use the created python
		$ source ~/bin/python2715
	create a virtualenv python; its top-level directory will be python2715
		$ virtualenv python2715
		New python executable in $PROJECT/python2715/bin/python2.7
		Also creating executable in $PROJECT/python2715/bin/python
		Installing setuptools, pip, wheel...done.

	use it
		$ source python2715/bin/activate
	notice that your prompt is now prefixed with '(python2715)'

-5- Add more packages with pip to the new python2715 for your project
